# Task for Claude 4: Run Comprehensive Test Suite

## Current Status Summary

As the Orchestrator (Claude 0), I've done initial investigation and found:

1. **Core test suite (test_all.py)**: Runs successfully with 79 tests, 2 skipped
2. **Recorded tests**: Most are failing due to snapshot mismatches, not code issues
3. **Main issues identified**:
   - GitHub API tests fail with 401 (no token) instead of expected 403 (rate limit)
   - Some snapshot files are missing
   - Minor output differences causing snapshot failures

## Your Task, Claude 4

Please run the comprehensive test suite and create a final report:

1. **Run the full test suite**:
   ```bash
   cd /mnt/c/python/onefilellm
   python tests/run_all_tests.py
   ```

2. **If that doesn't work, run tests separately**:
   ```bash
   # Unit tests
   python tests/test_all.py
   
   # Recorded tests (pytest)
   python -m pytest tests/test_recorded_*.py -v --tb=short
   ```

3. **Create a summary report** including:
   - Total tests run vs passed
   - Categories of failures (snapshot vs actual bugs)
   - Any actual code issues found
   - Recommendations for fixes

4. **Check if we need to**:
   - Update snapshots with `--snapshot-update`
   - Fix any actual import or compatibility issues
   - Add missing configuration

The goal is to confirm that the onefilellm codebase is functionally working and identify only the "minor test changes" needed as mentioned in implementation.md.
