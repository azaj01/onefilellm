# Task for Claude 1: Fix GitHub Token Warning in Tests

## Your Assignment

The tests are showing a warning about missing GITHUB_TOKEN that's causing snapshot mismatches. Your task:

1. **Investigate the current fix**:
   - Check `tests/harness_claude1.py` - I see it already sets `GITHUB_TOKEN='dummy-token-for-testing'`
   - Verify if this is working correctly

2. **Test if the warning is still appearing**:
   ```bash
   cd /mnt/c/python/onefilellm
   python -m pytest tests/test_recorded_github_onefilellm.py -v -s
   ```

3. **If warning persists, investigate**:
   - Check if onefilellm.py is checking for the token differently
   - See if we need to set it in conftest.py or elsewhere
   - Ensure the dummy token is being recognized

4. **Fix any remaining token warnings** to ensure clean test output

This will help reduce snapshot failures related to GitHub API authentication.
