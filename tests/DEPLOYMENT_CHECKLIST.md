  - [ ] `tests/TROUBLESHOOTING.md`
- [ ] Ensure all team members can run basic tests:
  ```bash
  python tests/run_all_tests.py
  ```
- [ ] Verify output formatting works (Rich library)
- [ ] Address any environment-specific issues

### Day 2: Hands-On Training
- [ ] Demonstrate test execution options:
  - [ ] Running all tests
  - [ ] Running specific frameworks
  - [ ] Different output formats
  - [ ] Parallel execution
- [ ] Show how to debug failing tests
- [ ] Practice updating snapshots:
  ```bash
  python tests/run_all_tests.py --framework pytest --snapshot-update
  ```
- [ ] Review test categories and organization

### Day 3: Advanced Features
- [ ] Integration test setup and execution
- [ ] Environment variable configuration
- [ ] CI/CD pipeline walkthrough
- [ ] Performance optimization techniques
- [ ] Custom test development guidelines

## CI/CD Deployment ✓

### GitHub Actions Setup
- [ ] Create `.github/workflows/` directory
- [ ] Deploy `test-suite.yml` workflow
- [ ] Configure repository secrets:
  - [ ] `GITHUB_TOKEN` (if using custom token)
  - [ ] Any API keys needed for integration tests
- [ ] Enable GitHub Actions for the repository
- [ ] Run workflow manually to verify:
  ```
  Actions → Test Suite → Run workflow
  ```

### Pipeline Validation
- [ ] Verify workflow triggers on:
  - [ ] Push to main branch
  - [ ] Pull request creation
  - [ ] Scheduled runs (if configured)
- [ ] Check all job outputs:
  - [ ] Unit tests pass
  - [ ] Recorded tests pass
  - [ ] Coverage reports generated
  - [ ] Test artifacts uploaded
- [ ] Validate multi-platform testing (Linux, Windows, macOS)

### Monitoring Setup
- [ ] Configure notifications for test failures
- [ ] Set up coverage tracking (Codecov/similar)
- [ ] Create test status badges for README
- [ ] Document escalation process for failures

## Documentation Updates ✓

### Repository Documentation
- [ ] Update main README.md with:
  - [ ] Test suite information
  - [ ] Badge for test status
  - [ ] Link to test documentation
- [ ] Add testing section to CONTRIBUTING.md
- [ ] Update development setup guides

### Test Documentation
- [ ] Review and update `tests/readme.md`
- [ ] Ensure all test categories documented
- [ ] Add examples for common test scenarios
- [ ] Document any project-specific test patterns

## Performance Baseline ✓

### Execution Time Benchmarks
- [ ] Record baseline test execution times:
  ```bash
  time python tests/run_all_tests.py
  ```
- [ ] Document expected durations:
  - [ ] Unit tests only: ~2-3 minutes
  - [ ] All tests: ~10-15 minutes
  - [ ] With integration: ~20-30 minutes
- [ ] Identify any unusually slow tests
- [ ] Set up performance tracking

### Resource Usage
- [ ] Monitor memory usage during test runs
- [ ] Check disk space requirements for snapshots
- [ ] Validate CPU usage (especially parallel runs)
- [ ] Document any resource constraints

## Team Integration ✓

### Development Workflow
- [ ] Establish test-first development practices
- [ ] Define when to run which tests:
  - [ ] Pre-commit: Unit tests
  - [ ] Pre-push: All tests
  - [ ] PR creation: Full suite with integration
- [ ] Set up pre-commit hooks (optional):
  ```bash
  pre-commit install
  ```

### Code Review Process
- [ ] Update PR template to include test checklist
- [ ] Require test passage before merge
- [ ] Document test review guidelines
- [ ] Establish test coverage requirements

## Post-Deployment Monitoring ✓

### Week 1 Checkpoints
- [ ] Daily standup item: Test suite status
- [ ] Address any recurring failures
- [ ] Collect team feedback on:
  - [ ] Ease of use
  - [ ] Documentation clarity
  - [ ] Performance issues
  - [ ] Missing features

### Week 2 Review
- [ ] Analyze test execution patterns
- [ ] Review failure rates and causes
- [ ] Optimize slow-running tests
- [ ] Update documentation based on feedback
- [ ] Plan for any needed improvements

### Month 1 Assessment
- [ ] Full test suite health check
- [ ] Team adoption metrics
- [ ] CI/CD pipeline performance review
- [ ] Documentation completeness audit
- [ ] Plan for next phase improvements

## Rollback Plan ✓

### If Issues Arise
1. **Immediate Fallback**:
   ```bash
   # Run original test suite only
   python tests/test_all.py
   ```

2. **Partial Rollback**:
   - Disable problematic test framework
   - Use `--framework` flag to run working suite
   - Document issues for resolution

3. **Full Rollback**:
   - Revert to previous test infrastructure
   - Keep unified runner for gradual migration
   - Address issues before re-deployment
